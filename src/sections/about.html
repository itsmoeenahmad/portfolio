            <p>
                I'm a Senior Mobile App Engineer who enjoys building apps that actually work well and are easy to maintain.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of my work is around Mobile App Engineering using Flutter & Dart. I focus on writing clean, scalable code using Clean Architecture, MVVM and feature-based structure, so apps stay maintainable as they grow.
            </p>
            <p>
                I work a lot with UI design, responsiveness, and localization—making sure apps look good and work properly across different screen sizes and languages.
            </p>
            <p>
                I regularly integrate REST APIs, handle app logic, manage state and focus on performance and stability.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the backend side, I mostly work with Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage, Notifications) and I've also done some hands-on work with Supabase based on project needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                I handle the complete app lifecycle, including development, testing, deployment and long-term maintenance. This includes TestFlight builds, Play Store releases, CI/CD pipelines and versioning to ship updates smoothly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alongside mobile app engineering, I also work with Generative AI using Python. Mostly building chatbots, RAG systems, agentic AI systems and small AI automations that support products and internal tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also manage DevOps and cloud work using Docker, Git, GitHub Actions and platforms like AWS, GCP, Railway and Koyeb.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of work, I speak at tech events and enjoy sharing what I learn with the community.
            </p>

                Still learning. Still building.
