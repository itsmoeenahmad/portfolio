            <p>
                I'm a Senior Mobile App Engineer specializing in Flutter & Dart. I build scalable, maintainable apps
                using Clean Architecture, MVVM, and feature-based structure with focus on UI design, responsiveness,
                localization, and performance.
            </p>
            <p>
                I handle the complete lifecycle from REST API integration and state management to TestFlight, Play Store
                releases, and CI/CD pipelines. On the backend, I work with Firebase and Supabase for Auth, Firestore,
                Storage, and Notifications.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alongside mobile engineering, I build Generative AI solutions using Python chatbots, RAG systems,
                agentic AI, and automations that support products and internal tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also manage DevOps and cloud infrastructure using Docker, Git, GitHub Actions, AWS, GCP, Railway, and
                Koyeb. Outside of work, I speak at tech events and share knowledge with the community.
